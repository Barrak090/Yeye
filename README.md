I’ve been meaning to tell you something for a while. I’ve developed strong feelings for you, though I’m not sure when it all started. Since grade 9, I’ve admired you, Thinking about you always makes me smile. Even when we don’t talk, being with you brings me immense happiness and brightens my life.Tho sometimes I feel like you're forcing yourself from Talking with me. But I just want you to know you mean alot to me."></textarea><br>
